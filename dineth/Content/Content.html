                In general, water quality denotes the physical , biological, chemical, and radiological features of water. 
                Its primary function is to rate the level of suitability of water for several uses, including drinking, swimming, irrigation, and industrial boilers. 
                These factors of characteristics of water comprise pH, DO, metabolism, nutrients of nitrogen and phosphorus, pollutants, temperature and so on. 
                Suitable water quality is a prerequisite for healthy human existence, ecosystem survival, and responsible economic development. 
                As a result, monitoring and controlling water quality is a requirement to ensure all people access to uncontaminated water.</p>

                During early ages and ancient civilizations, water quality was determined by appearance, smell, and taste. 
                People drank water from rivers, lakes, and streams for cooking and bathing. They lacked modern sanitation infrastructure, leading to waterborne diseases and health problems. 
                Traditional knowledge systems were used to solve water-related issues, but exposure to infections remained high. Access to clean water was based on luck and opportunities, causing illness and deaths. 
                Communities appreciated the value of clean water and sought safe methods.

                Water quality is a major concern in the modern world because of rising pollution levels, changing climate patterns, and population expansion. 
                In many areas, inappropriate garbage management, industrialization, and agricultural runoff have all severely reduced the quality of the water. 
                Ecosystems and human health are at risk from contaminants such viruses, metals, and medications. Millions of people worldwide still struggle to get access to clean drinking water, especially in developing nations. 
                Strict laws, innovations in water treatment and filtration technology, conservation strategies, and public awareness campaigns are used to solve problems with water quality. 
                But maintaining sustainable management of water resources and guaranteeing universal access to clean water continue to be worldwide priority to protect public health and the environment for future.

            <h4>How to improve water quality </h4>
            <p>
                Stricter laws, investments in wetlands and riparian zones, sustainable farming methods, water conservation education, and the adoption of cutting-edge technologies are all necessary to improve the quality of water. 
                Governments, businesses, communities, and environmental organizations must work together to adopt comprehensive programs that guarantee everyone has access to clean and safe water. 
                Adopting cutting-edge filtration technologies, encouraging appropriate waste disposal methods, and teaching communities about water conservation and garbage disposal techniques are also crucial.
