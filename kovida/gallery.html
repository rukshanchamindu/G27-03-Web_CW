              <h2>Clean Water and Sanitation</h2>
              <p>
                Lack of water, an essential life resource, is expected
                 to affect one-third of the population worldwide by 2025.
                  Today, 1.2 billion people live in areas of scarcity, while 
                  1.6 billion face water shortages due to economic problems.

                The Water Quality Blueprint 2.0, an interactive web-based map,
                 prioritizes restoration and protection of wetlands, floodplain forests,
                  and river corridors that naturally filter out pollution from sources
                   like erosion and agricultural and stormwater run-off.

              <h2>Importance of Sanitation</h2>
              <p>
                To improve sanitation and access to drinking water,
                 there needs to be increased investment in management of freshwater 
                 ecosystems and sanitation facilities on a local level in several developing 
                 countries within Sub-Saharan Africa, Central Asia, Southern Asia, Eastern Asia and South-Eastern Asia.

              <p>
                The changing climate is making it harder to find 
                safe water, forcing people into poverty, as they must
                 spend time sourcing water, instead of working.
                 We canâ€™t stop flooding or drought, but we can limit 
                 the effect it has on people and their access to water.

              <p>
                World Water Day emphasises the importance of 
                water and sanitation measures in reducing poverty,
                 enhancing economic growth, and ensuring environmental
                  sustainability. It also emphasises accomplishing Sustainable Development Goal 6: water and sanitation for all by 2030.

              <h2>Environmental Sanitation</h2>
              <p>
                Environmental sanitation is more than just a matter of 
                aesthetics; it is a critical component of public health, 
                quality of life, and long-term development. A clean and 
                well-maintained environment contributes to the physical 
                and psychological individuals while fostering 
                a sense of community pride and responsibility.

                During a global pandemic, people are making sure their offices,
                 buildings, factories, warehouses are cleaned regularly. It has
                  become everyone's responsibility to maintain a clean and sanitized
                   workplace.Sanitizing is a great habit, but it becomes doubly 
                   essential in circumstances threatened by a pandemic.

              <p>
                Conflict and climate change contribute to the scarcity of 
                clean water in many parts of the world. Droughts are becoming more frequent
                 and severe. Flooding destroys and contaminates water sources. War and insecurity
                  make it more difficult for farmers to get to their fields and for food to reach markets.

              <p>
                Clean, accessible water for all is an essential part of the world we want to live in.
                 There is sufficient fresh water on the planet to achieve this. But due to bad
                  economics or poor infrastructure, every year millions of people 
                  die from diseases associated with inadequate water supply, sanitation and hygiene.
